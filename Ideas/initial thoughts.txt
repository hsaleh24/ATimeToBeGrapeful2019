- spur of the moment
- long awaited social gathering
- short in Canada after the long winter

* enjoy what you have, while you have it - people, wine, etc.

=========================================

How to depict this visually?

- have the wine in motion: gives a sense of energy, enjoyment, excitement
- 2 ppl clinking glasses: gives the ppl element. General motion of the piece can give references to spring (flowers, etc.)

* fountains? wine is "dancing"?

- watercolour

* table with abstract wine glasses and bottles?
