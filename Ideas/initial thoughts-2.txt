Some actual ideas:
==================
1. Have a solid silhouette style glass upright being used as a table. 2 ppl around it socializing. Have abstract around it to show spring feeling (spring-wine-glass-candle-holders-1 and Spring-wine-tasting-2016-273x300 and abstract splashes from 544443940-1024x1024). Have grapes or flowers hanging from above looking like chandalier! (watercolour-wine-set-bright-design-elements-47033352). Maybe can have abstract splashes in the back to suggest the energy of a "spur of the moment"/a one dance.
2. Have the bottles/glasses on table + spring flowers/butterflies spell out a time to be grapeful. (bigstock-128875547)
3. Have a person holding a wine glass with passion ("dance with me. - honhon53")


Things i need in my design:
